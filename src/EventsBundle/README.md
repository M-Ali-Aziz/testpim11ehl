EventsBundle
===========

This bundle gives you an easy interface for creating and managing Events


## Getting started

Before you use this bundle make sure that you have a DataObject Class named `Events`
initialized in Pimcore under _Settings > DataObject > Classes_

Set three variables under _Settings > Website_

```
Type	Name
-------------------------
Text 	eventsParentId
```

__eventsParentId__ is the ID of a Folder where you want the bundle to put your Events objects.
